# favorite_movies
This is a project done in a Udacity course.

This course focuses on teaching Object-Oriented Programming.

All the files that I used were done in the IDLE program of Python.

The project of the course requiered us to create a page in which it could show our favorite movies, and when clicked it would
show the trailer of the movie.

Also it was requiered that we use the language of Python, because it is an object-oriented program. 

As part of the course, we were supposed to download a file called, fresh_tomatoes.py, so that our code in python code be shown
in a webpage. The file has code in HTML and CSS, where the design of the page is explained and done. 

We were requiered only to do the part of the code in Python. 

In order to understand each part of the code, users must have to know and understand HTML, CSS, and Python. 

Users must have to download the fresh_tomatoes file, as well as the files called movies.py and movie_center.py. So that they 
can create their own versions of the code.
